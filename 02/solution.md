Each alternative takes the at most the following amount of operations:

* $\delta_B(I) \implies (N - M)^2 = N^2 - 2 N M + M^2$


* $\delta_C(\delta_D(I)) \implies 2 * (N - M) * N = 2 N^2 - 2 N M$

This means that the dilation using $B$ as structuring element is more efficient in terms of numbre of operations than using first $D$ and then $C$.
