## Exercise 09a

Proof the idempotence of the 'closingâˆ’opening' alternated filter.

CbOb ?= CbObCbOp
In general, increasing operators in order to prove an equiality, it's easier tp prove both inequalities <= and > :

- CbOb >= CbObCbOp
- CbOb <= CbObCbOp

## 1

CbObObOb == CbOb -> Ob idempotent
CbObCbOb >= CbOb

## 2

CbCbCbOb == CbOb -> Cb idempotent
CbObCbOb <= CbOb
...
...
CbObCbOb = CbOb
